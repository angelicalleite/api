## api - version 1.0

This is a small public api service that allows the users to query against the SiBBr's occurrence data portal information.

Basic queries implemented:
- Occurrence search given a scientific name

Information returned:

Database setup:
- Connect to database entering your database credentials directly to the DatabaseConnection class, under the connectToDatabaseOrDie() method.
